## Exploratory Data Analysis for the Women's Tournament

This is the Markdown file for exploring the data and hypotheses for the Women's NCAA Tournament.

Some hypotheses:

1. Teams get better as the season progresses.
2. A great offense and a great defense should be the best team. Causal factors:
      -pace/fitness of both teams (tire the other team out or they both can keep up)
      -three pointers made
      -total rebounds
      -avg. turnovers committed
      -avg. turnovers produced
      -free throw percentage
      -blocks
      -point difference
      -free throws attempted by other team
      -field goals attempted by both teams
      -differences in some of these metrics?
      
      
3. Geographical distance matters for a couple reasons:
      -Fans: Teams playing closer to home can have more fans at the games
      -Refs: Refs feel social pressure and favor the team closer to home
      -Health: It's harder to perform physically when you have to travel a long distance


```{r setup, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
## Read in regular season data
library(tidyverse)
reg_season <- read.csv("WRegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(reg_season)

sum(is.na(reg_season))

reg_season$low_team <- do.call(pmin, reg_season[,c("WTeamID", "LTeamID")])
reg_season$high_team <- do.call(pmax, reg_season[,c("WTeamID", "LTeamID")])

reg_season$low_win <- ifelse(reg_season$low_team == reg_season$WTeamID, 1, 0)

reg_season$low_loc <- ifelse(reg_season$low_win == 1, print(reg_season$WLoc),
                             ifelse(reg_season$WLoc == "H", "A",
                                    ifelse(reg_season$WLoc == "A", "H", "N")))

reg_season <- subset(reg_season, select = -WLoc)

win_metrics <- reg_season[reg_season$low_win == 1,]
loss_metrics <- reg_season[reg_season$low_win == 0,]


colnames(win_metrics) <- gsub("W", "low_team_", colnames(win_metrics))
colnames(win_metrics) <- gsub("L", "high_team_", colnames(win_metrics))

colnames(loss_metrics) <- gsub("W", "high_team_", colnames(loss_metrics))
colnames(loss_metrics) <- gsub("L", "low_team_", colnames(loss_metrics))

win_metrics <- win_metrics[ , order(names(win_metrics))]

loss_metrics <- loss_metrics[ , order(names(loss_metrics))]

identical(names(win_metrics), names(loss_metrics))

new_regs <- rbind(loss_metrics, win_metrics)
